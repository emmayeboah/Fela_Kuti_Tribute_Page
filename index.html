          <p class="small-p">Yes, if you are in England, the music can be an instrument of enjoyment .You can sing about when you are going to build with the next lady.But in my own environment, my society is underdeveloped because of an alien system on our people.So there is nothing like no music enjoyment. There is something like struggle for people's existence. </p>
